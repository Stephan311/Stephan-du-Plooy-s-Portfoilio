Stephan du Plooy's Portfoilio

This project was created with the purpose of showcasing my previous work for a job application that employers can view. This project includes a short description about me and my company, and 5 pieces of work which are published on the internet, plus a contact section with links to my LinkedIn profile and Email address. Doing this project taught me how to arrange things in CSS, using a grid layout to showcase my work, and how to optimize websites for different screen sizes. I faced multiple challenges when I tried to link each grid card to it's respective website, due to me placing <a> tags in the wrong section inside of the HTML. In conclusion, building this website taught me a lot about troubleshooting issues and the core propertis of CSS.
